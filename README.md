# Project: Real-Time Ping Pong Game

This project delivers a feature-complete real-time Pygame Ping Pong game with robust mechanics and modern game feel enhancements. Key implementations include accurate collision physics with high-speed tunneling prevention, a difficulty system that increases ball speed on every hit, and full sound feedback for game events. The game features a replay loop allowing players to select match lengths (Best of 3/5/7) from a dedicated Game Over menu, ensuring high replayability within a clean, modular object-oriented structure.
